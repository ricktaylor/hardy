# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us privately.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature to report the issue. You can do this by going to the "Security" tab of the repository and clicking on "Report a vulnerability".

This will ensure that the vulnerability is disclosed to us privately, so that we can address it before it is publicly disclosed.

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure.
